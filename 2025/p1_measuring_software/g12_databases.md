# Measuring the Energy Consumption of SQL vs NoSQL

For our project, we decided to try measuring the difference between the energy consumption between SQL and NoSQL. Specifically, we want to know if there is a significant difference between the two when making many simple requests.

## Experimental Setup

For our setup, we of course make use of Zen Mode in order to minimize superfluous energy usage.

The plan is to run a version of the SQL database and make about 100(?) requests, since a single request would likely have a small energy profile by itself. This way, the energy profile of the requests should become clearer. After making these requests for the SQL database, we duplicate the experiment with the NoSQL database.
