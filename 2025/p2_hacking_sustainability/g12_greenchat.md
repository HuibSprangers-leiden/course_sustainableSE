title: "Greenchat"
summary: "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily activities, its environmental impact often remains unnoticed. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT consume significant computational resources, leading to high energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption. While users are growing, there is limited transparency regarding the resource demands of these systems, leaving end users unaware of their digital footprint. This paper introduces GreenChat, a browser extension designed to provide real-time feedback on the environmental impact of ChatGPT conversations. By estimating energy consumption, carbon emissions and water usage, the tool aims to increase user awareness and encourage more sustainable AI usage. We present the design and implementation of the extension, the methodology behind its estimations, and a case study assessing its effectiveness in influencing user behaviour. Our findings highlight the challenges of accurately quantifying AIâ€™s environmental impact and explore the broader implications of integrating sustainability metrics into user-facing applications."
